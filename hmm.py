'''Script for computing GC-rich and GC-poor intervals in a given sequence.
Arguments:
    -f: file containing the sequence (fasta file)
    -mu: the probability of switching states
    -out: file to output intervals to (1 interval per line)

Outputs:
    File with list of intervals (a_i, b_i) such that bases a_i to b_i are
    classified as GC-rich.
    
Example Usage:
    python 2a.py -f hmm-sequence.fasta -mu 0.01 -out viterbi-intervals.txt

''' Outputs the Viterbi decoding of a given observation.
Arguments:
	obs: list of N M-char sequences
	trans_probs: A x A matrix of transition log probs
	phylo: A x M log likelihood matrix
	init_probs: A x 1 matrix of initial log probs
Returns:
	l: list of most likely hidden states at each position
        (list of hidden states)
	p: log-probability of the returned hidden state sequence
